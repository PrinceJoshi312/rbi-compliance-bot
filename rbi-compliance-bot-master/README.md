# 🧠 RBI Compliance Bot

This project is a simple but powerful tool that helps banks, NBFCs, and compliance teams make sense of RBI circulars — without reading through hundreds of pages manually.

It lets you upload official circular PDFs, ask questions in plain English (like “What are the new KYC rules?”), and even generates department-wise action points for teams like Compliance, IT, Legal, or Customer Support.

Whether you're a compliance officer, part of a legal team, or someone trying to stay on top of changing RBI guidelines, this bot saves you time and effort.

## 💡 What It Does

- 📄 Upload one or more RBI circulars (PDF)
- ❓ Ask questions like:
  - “What’s the new definition of an NPA?”
  - “What does the circular say about digital lending?”
  - “What’s the compliance deadline?”
- 🏛️ Get department-wise actionable steps (Compliance, IT, Legal, etc.)

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses **LangChain** to break down and retrieve content from circulars
- **Google Gemini Pro** (via API) to generate intelligent responses
- **FAISS** for storing and searching document chunks
- Built with **Streamlit** for a clean and simple web interface
